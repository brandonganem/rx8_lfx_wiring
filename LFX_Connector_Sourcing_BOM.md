## Sourcing Tips
*   **Ballenger Motorsports:** The links above take you directly to the connector kits which include the housing, terminals, and seals. This is generally cheaper and cleaner than buying pigtails.
*   **Mouser / DigiKey:** You can search these sites using the "Housing P/N" if you need to buy in bulk (50+ units), but you must order terminals and seals separately.
*   **RockAuto / Amazon:** Use the ACDelco Pigtail P/N (e.g., PT2345) if you specifically need a pre-wired pigtail for a quick repair.
